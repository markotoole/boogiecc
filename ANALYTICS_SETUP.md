## üìä Google Analytics Setup

### Step 1: Create Google Analytics Account

2. Reporting time zone: Choose your timezone
3. Currency: Choose your currency
4. Click "Next"

### Step 5: Get Your Measurement ID

1. You'll see your **Measurement ID** (format: G-XXXXXXXXXX)
2. Copy this ID - you'll need it next

### Step 6: Add to Your Website

1. In your **local environment**, create or update your `.env.local` file:
   ```bash
   NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-XXXXXXXXXX  # Replace with your actual ID
   ```

2. **For Vercel deployment**, add this environment variable:
   - Go to your Vercel dashboard
   - Select your project
   - Go to Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
   - Add: `NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID` with your measurement ID
   - Redeploy your site

## üîç Google Search Console Setup

### Step 1: Access Search Console

1. Go to [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console/)
2. Sign in with the same Google account used for Analytics

### Step 2: Add Your Property

1. Click "Add Property"
2. Choose "URL prefix" method
3. Enter: `https://boogiecc.vercel.app`
4. Click "Continue"

### Step 3: Verify Ownership

Choose **HTML tag method** (recommended):

1. Google will show you a verification meta tag like:
   ```html
   <meta name="google-site-verification" content="ABC123...XYZ" />
   ```

2. Copy the content value (the part between quotes after `content=`)

3. Add it to your `.env.local` file:
   ```bash
   GOOGLE_SITE_VERIFICATION=ABC123...XYZ  # Replace with your code
   ```

4. **Update your layout.tsx** (or I can do this for you):
   - Uncomment the meta tag in the head section
   - The site will automatically use your verification code

5. **For Vercel**, add the environment variable there too and redeploy

6. Go back to Search Console and click "Verify"

### Step 4: Submit Your Sitemap

1. In Search Console, go to "Sitemaps" in the left sidebar
2. Enter: `sitemap.xml`

The site includes a `trackEvent` function for custom analytics:

```javascript
import { trackEvent } from '@/components/GoogleAnalytics'

// Track contact form submissions
trackEvent('form_submit', {
  form_name: 'contact',
  method: 'email'
})

// Track artist page visits
trackEvent('page_view', {
  page_type: 'artist',
  artist_name: 'Count Nine'
})
```

### Structured Data Benefits
Your site automatically includes rich data for:

This helps Google understand your content and may show rich snippets in search results!
